# Old-Memory
A restoration of Old Memory, a plugin for endless sky. Meant only for archival purposes and to make it playable.
With the recent addition of ship categories, some ship have been changed to be in a category more in line with what they were originally envisioned to be. All other balance issues persist and will remain unchanged. The only changes made are those to make the game function with the current release of the game. There will be no further development for this plugin on my behalf, but anyone is free to adopt and expand on the ideas in it if they want to.
Recommended you use the Forge Support plugin (https://github.com/myvee/Forge-Support) if you'd like to purchase the ships and weapons, as they are locked behind licenses
